        <li><strong>Researching the college</strong>: Start researching about the colleges early and make a list of colleges you want to apply to. The best way you can make the list is by dividing the colleges into 3 categories.<br><br>

            <strong>Safety colleges</strong>: Colleges you feel you can easily get into with a good scholarship. These colleges have a high acceptance rate and your scores should be higher than the average score of college. You should always list at least 3 safety colleges.<br><br>
            
                <strong>Target Colleges</strong>: Colleges whose academic profile matches with your academic profile. This means that your average GPA, ACT/SAT score is on par with the average accepted students scores.</br><br>
            
                    <span style="color:blue">Reach / Dream colleges</span>: Often, your dream college can be competitive and they can have an academic profile higher than yours. Maybe you have a 3.5 GPA and your reach schoolâ€™s average is a 3.9 GPA. Your grades may be out of range, but getting accepted is still possible with a killer essay and the right standardized test scores</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Testing</strong>: After sorting out the Universities you want to apply to, take a Test that is required by your Universities. We highly recommend you to take the SAT and you can choose between IELTS and TOEFL according to what your university asks for. You can use the platform such as 1600.io, khan academy, Reedit to prepare for the SAT. Usually, you can take the SAT 3 times a year in Nepal, during March, October, and December. If you do not get a good score during 1st time, you can always go for the next time. This can boost your score!</li><br>
        <li>Do not lose your confidence if you get low scores in your test.!Testing is only one factor in the college application and college looks into many factors while making a decision. Having said that, prepare well for the test!!</li><br>
        <li><span style="color:blue">Common Application:</span> Use a Common Application to apply to colleges. With Common Application, you can use 1 application to apply to multiple colleges. So, this can save a lot of your time. Colleges also waive your application fee if you apply via Common Application, so this can be the best platform to apply to colleges. Consultancy applies from Common Application on your behalf, and they take money from you in the name of Application fees which the University never asks for. So, be smart, and apply from Common Application</li><br>
        <li><span style="color:blue">Letter of Recommendation:</span> While applying to colleges, you may need letter of Recommendation. So, reach to the high school teacher who personally knows you well and request them to write a good recommendation letter for you. Reach out to your teacher earlier so that he/she gets enough time to write recommendation letter for you. Just ask your teacher to write, He is a good person, well-behaved, and disciplined student â€™.Your recommendation should be specific about you, and should tell about your qualities.</li><br>
        <li><span style="color:blue">Deadline-</span> Be aware of the Deadlines. Do not wait until the last day to apply to colleges! Make a timeline for yourself so that you will not miss any deadlines for the college.</li><br>
        <li><span style="color:blue">Contact:</span> Do not hesitate to email your Admission Officer. They are there to help you! So, if you have any questions, ask your admission officer. Also, get in contact with the International Nepali students. They can help you a lot by sharing their experiences and you can use the Facebook page like USVNS to contact them and collect more information.</li><br>
        <li><span style="color:blue">Sending Score to colleges-</span> It takes 12$ and 20 $ to send SAT and TOEFL score to 1 University (32$ in Total). If you apply to many colleges, the cost of sending the scores can be big and you may not afford it too. So, it is very important to know that some universities accept your electronic results (PDF) of your score or accepts the scores if your counselor sends them on your behalf. So, ask your admission if you can send them the electronic results or if your guidance counselor can send them. This way you can reduce the cost of sending the scores. Your one email to the admission officer can save your 32$!!</li><br>
